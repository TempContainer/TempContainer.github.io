::: {#about-spec}

I am currently a senior undergraduate student at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), pursuing a B.Eng. in Software Engineering.

I am broadly interested in generating vivid, realistic, and interactive visual content at the intersection of computer graphics and machine learning. I am also greatly interested in applying these technologies to a wide range of applications, such as AIGC, embodied AI, VR/XR. Here is my [research proposal]().

::: {.callout-important appearance="simple"}
I am applying for PhD programs in Fall 2025. If you are a potential advisor or would like to support my application, please get in touch.
